# passwordGenWithJS

## Description
This purpose of this project is to create a webpage that allows you to randomly generate a secure password, choosing between a range of options. With the HTML, CSS, and some of the JavaScript already provided, the development of this project involved creating a JavaScript function that can be called to generate the password whenever a button is clicked. It accopmlishes this by declaring variables containing character options, prompting the user to choose a character length and character types, validating those choices with if statements, and using a do...while loop to randomly select the characters and assign them to the password. It then returns the password as a string and displays it for the user to copy.

## Installation

You'll then be provided with a unique, randomly generated password! Take a look at the JavaScript file to learn more about the basic usage of variables, array methods, functions, if statements, loops, and other JavaScript concepts.
